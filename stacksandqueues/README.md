In this folder you can find three classes:

Node class:
 - has a value (I chose a string in this case)
 - has a reference to the next node.

Stack class:
 - push method: adds a node with an input value to the top of the stack.
 - pop method: removes a node from the top of the stack and returns it's value.
 - peek method: returns the value of the top node of the stack.
 - isEmpty method: returns a boolean value whether stack is empty or not.
 
 Queue class:
  - enqueue method: adds a node with an input value to the back of the queue.
  - dequeue method: removes a node from the front of the queue and returns it's value.
  - peek method: returns the value of the front node of the queue.
  - isEmpty method: returns a boolean value whether queue is empty or not.
