# Reverse an Array
Reversing an array 

## Challenge
given an array of integers, our function needs to return the same array but reversed without using any built it methods.

## Approach & Efficiency
-We created an additional array with the same length as the input array.
-created a counter variable and set it to 0 to hold a value of the first index of our new array.
-ran a loop to iterate backwards through the input array. 
-compared the last element in the input array to the first in the new array 
- and incremented counter by 1.

lastly we returned the new array.
